### Solved by Swappage

x-y-z was another misc challenge from 0ops CTF.
We were provided with a txt file (a csv actually) containing a series of numbers.

```
-4.751373,-2.622809,2.428588;-4.435134,-3.046589,2.406030;-4.788052,-2.661979,2.464709

We weren't given any hint except from the challenge name, but it was easly possible to guess that the numbers in the csv file were 3d coordinates, and that each line represented a triangle that we needed to plot in a 3d environment.

The correct printing would have probably returned the flag as a 3d image.

So it's

    x,y,z;x,y,z;x,y,z -> triangle

I'm not used to plotting, so i assembled this (horrible) python script by gathering examples and code snipplets from here and there.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import MaxNLocator
from matplotlib import cm
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

import numpy as np
from numpy.random import randn
from scipy import array, newaxis

DATA = []
triangles = []

counter = 0


with open("x-y-z") as f:
  lines = f.readlines()
  for line in lines:
    if counter < 5:
      #counter = counter + 1
      points = line.rstrip("\r\n").split(";")
      t = []
      for point in points:
        x = float(point.split(",")[0])
        y = float(point.split(",")[1])
        z = float(point.split(",")[2])
        p = [x, y, z]
        t.append(p)

      triangles.append(t)


Xs = []
Ys = []
Zs = []

for triangle in triangles:
  #print triangle
  verts = np.array(triangle)

  Xs.append(verts[:,0])
  Ys.append(verts[:,1])
  Zs.append(verts[:,2])


fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

surf = []

for i in range(0, len(Xs)):
  surf.append(ax.plot_trisurf(Xs[i], Ys[i], Zs[i], cmap=cm.jet, linewidth=0))

  ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(MaxNLocator(5))
  ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(MaxNLocator(6))
  ax.zaxis.set_major_locator(MaxNLocator(5))


plt.show()
```

and to be honest i was quiet surprised myself when i figured out that it worked :)
